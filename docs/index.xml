        <italic>Reburn and Return: How Invasive Species Influence Fire
  Return Intervals in Colorado.</italic>
      </title>

        <underline>
          <bold>Introduction, Background and
  Motivation</bold>
        </underline>
      </p>
      <p>Invasive plants and forest fires are significant issues in
  Colorado. Fire intensity and frequency, as well as the dominance of
  invasive species  are increasing in Colorado.   Invasions by
  non-native plant species after fire can negatively impact important
  ecosystem services and lead to invasion-fire cycles, which ultimately
  further degrade ecosystems Prevéy et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-prevey2024non" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>)
  . Invasive species have negative impacts on ecosystems not limited to
  fire return intervals. Some of these impacts are disruption of species
  interactions, impact on successional recovery, introduction and spread
  of diseases, reduction in native species diversity, and economic
  losses Gallardo, Clavero, Sánchez, &amp; Vilà
  (<xref alt="2016" rid="ref-gallardo2016global" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). </p>
      <p>Certain invasive species can alter fire frequencies and
  intensities, potentially increasing the occurrence of wildfires
  Gallardo et al.
  (<xref alt="2016" rid="ref-gallardo2016global" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>)
  . The influence of non-native species on forest fire regimes is
  complex and varies by vegetative functional type and geographic region
  Prevéy et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-prevey2024non" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>).
  This project will examine how different functional groups of invasive
  species impact fire return intervals, re-establishment rates, and
  expansion across Colorado. </p>
      <p>Furthermore, it has been established that native  species rely on
  soil microbiomes to establish on burned soil, while non-native do not;
  this makes non-natives more likely to establish quickly after forest
  fires and then dominate these disturbed sites Escobedo et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-escobedo2024native" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>).
  However, scientific understanding of how to restore plant-soil
  microbiome interactions after wildfires remains limited, leading to a
  key knowledge gap in post- fire ecosystem restoration Escobedo et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-escobedo2024native" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>).
  Escobedo’s research was done in a greenhouse in Chile, measuring
  establishment of native vs. non-native species in burned , unburned,
  and burned soil that was inoculated with native microbiome species
  Escobedo et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-escobedo2024native" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>). 
  The study found that burned soil had higher levels of available
  nutrients, which benefited non-native species Escobedo et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-escobedo2024native" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>).
  Furthermore, this study found that native species relied on the native
  microbiome while non-natives did not Escobedo et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-escobedo2024native" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>).
  Taking this study into account, once we see what invasive species are
  an issue in Colorado relating to fire intervals, and then use
  information about plant-soil microbiome interactions from Escobedo to
  see if this interaction could be furthering the issue. We are not sure
  exactly how this information will be used, but since it is relevant,
  we want to keep the option open to explore it. It is likely outside
  the scope of our research, but we are open to including it if we can
  find a way to.</p>
      <p> In this project, we will compare eight burned sites across
  Colorado that have experienced wildfires within the past 20 years.
  Sites will be selected to represent a range of geographic regions and
  burn severities, enabling analysis of how different conditions
  influence invasive species dynamics. In addition, two unburned sites
  serving as control locations will be selected from areas with no
  recorded wildfires during the same period. This site selection
  strategy aims to capture variability in post-fire plant communities
  and better understand the relationship between invasive species
  re-establishment risk and fire severity. </p>

          <bold>Data exploration</bold>
        </underline>
      </p>
      <p>The main dataset we will be using is current and future projection
  post-ire invasion risk by non-native short lived forbs and grasses
  Prevéy et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-prevey2024non" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>).
  This data is based on vegetation cover data from plots in the Western
  U.S that burned prior to sampling. Projected invasion risks post-fire
  were calculated using random forests with gridded climate, topographic
  predictor, and soil variables by Prevéy et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-prevey2024non" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>)
  .We will use the data projected under a high emission scenario. </p>
      <p>We will also use data from the USFS from 2005 that tracks invasive
  species prominence
  ( <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://research.fs.usda.gov/products/dataandtools/fia-datamart">https://research.fs.usda.gov/products/dataandtools/fia-datamart</ext-link>
  ). We will compare a total of 10 sites in Colorado that we will
  compare, trying to spread our sites out geographically and by severity
  of burn. We will pick sites that had been surveyed in 2005 and are
  also included in the projection data. </p>
      <p>Our projection data is in a spatial format, so we will need to
  extract data from longitude and latitude of the sites we select. We
  will also need data that shows fires in Colorado going back to at
  least 2005 that will include fire severity. </p>
      <p>In order to see where our spatial data and historic data overlap ,
  we had to take several steps. First I had to find a secondary dataset
  from the USFS that had latitude and longitude. Then, I preformed an
  innerjoin to get location information assigned to the sites:</p>

      <p>Next I had to get the data to show as points on a map:</p>

      <p>That produced the above image which is the spatial data showing

      <graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="png" xlink:href="img/overlayingdata.png"/>
      <p>I am still trying to learn how to work with spatial data and need
  some additional help with getting to a testing phase, but will be in
  office hours tomorrow.</p>
      <p>
        <underline>
          <bold>Methods</bold>
        </underline>
      </p>
      <p>The first test we will run will be to model the influence of a
  functional group of invasive species to see how that affects the
  projection for fire and an invasive return interval. We will try out
  several models including a linear regression, random forest, and
  Xgboost. We will also use a Bayesian model to get uncertainty
  estimates and a more flexible hierarchical structure to represent
  random effects for the region or species. We will find the best model
  and then we can use that to make projection predictions for sites that
  we don’t have projection data for.  </p>
      <p>The second test we will run is an ANOVA test. With this test we
  will see if the mean invasion risk across our sights vary
  significantly. We could also potentially see if the risk of forbs or
  grasses are significantly different. We could also use this test to
  see if different burn severitys lead to different invasion risk. </p>
      <p>I believe that we have all the data we need for this project
  between our two datasets. One piece of supplemental data that might be
  useful  is data showing forest fires in Colorado. This would allow us
  to explore urn severity and its correlation to invasion risk. I think
  GIS or another form of spatial data would be ideal for this, but we
  are not sure if we will be able to do this on top of the other goals
  we have outlined.</p>
      <p>A potential challenge is that our historic data counts invasive
  species, while the projection data projects invasion risk. Therefore
  we are going to have to figure out a way to make the two different
  types of data comparable. I think that a visualization of invasive
  cover could be useful and might help to bridge that gap. </p>
      <p>Along with handling spatial data, we also grapple with how we carry
  out our approaches. In addition to ANOVA, linear regression, random
  forest, and XGBoost models will be used to assess associations between
  fire severity, vegetation cover, and invasion threat. These models
  will inform us of linear and non-linear relationships and allow us to
  assess predictive performance. Spatial autocorrelation is also an
  issue as it could affect results if areas close to one another are too
  alike each other. Finally, as invasion and fire are persistent
  processes, it could be difficult to see evident patterns with
  predominantly new data, and therefore model calibration and validation
  would be an important part of our methodology.</p>
      <p>The methods including ANOVA and learning models like random forest
  and XGBoost, will enable us to identify the most important predictors
  of invasive species spread and their effects on fire return intervals.
  Using a suite of methods, we will assess the extent to which different
  factors—like fire severity and region—drive invasion risk and enable
  us to predict future invasive species patterns across Colorado. We
  hope to apply these methods to improve our knowledge of how invasive
  species are altering fire return intervals and ecosystem health,
  guiding management and restoration.</p>

          <italic>Reburn and Return: How Invasive Species Influence Fire
  Return Intervals in Colorado.</italic>

          <underline>
            <bold>Introduction, Background and
  Motivation</bold>
          </underline>
        </p>
        <p>Invasive plants and forest fires are significant issues in
  Colorado. Fire intensity and frequency, as well as the dominance of
  invasive species  are increasing in Colorado.   Invasions by
  non-native plant species after fire can negatively impact important
  ecosystem services and lead to invasion-fire cycles, which ultimately
  further degrade ecosystems Prevéy et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-prevey2024non-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>)
  . Invasive species have negative impacts on ecosystems not limited to
  fire return intervals. Some of these impacts are disruption of species
  interactions, impact on successional recovery, introduction and spread
  of diseases, reduction in native species diversity, and economic
  losses Gallardo, Clavero, Sánchez, &amp; Vilà
  (<xref alt="2016" rid="ref-gallardo2016global-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). </p>
        <p>Certain invasive species can alter fire frequencies and
  intensities, potentially increasing the occurrence of wildfires
  Gallardo et al.
  (<xref alt="2016" rid="ref-gallardo2016global-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>)
  . The influence of non-native species on forest fire regimes is
  complex and varies by vegetative functional type and geographic region
  Prevéy et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-prevey2024non-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>).
  This project will examine how different functional groups of invasive
  species impact fire return intervals, re-establishment rates, and
  expansion across Colorado. </p>
        <p>Furthermore, it has been established that native  species rely on
  soil microbiomes to establish on burned soil, while non-native do not;
  this makes non-natives more likely to establish quickly after forest
  fires and then dominate these disturbed sites Escobedo et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-escobedo2024native-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>).
  However, scientific understanding of how to restore plant-soil
  microbiome interactions after wildfires remains limited, leading to a
  key knowledge gap in post- fire ecosystem restoration Escobedo et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-escobedo2024native-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>).
  Escobedo’s research was done in a greenhouse in Chile, measuring
  establishment of native vs. non-native species in burned , unburned,
  and burned soil that was inoculated with native microbiome species
  Escobedo et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-escobedo2024native-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>). 
  The study found that burned soil had higher levels of available
  nutrients, which benefited non-native species Escobedo et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-escobedo2024native-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>).
  Furthermore, this study found that native species relied on the native
  microbiome while non-natives did not Escobedo et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-escobedo2024native-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>).
  Taking this study into account, once we see what invasive species are
  an issue in Colorado relating to fire intervals, and then use
  information about plant-soil microbiome interactions from Escobedo to
  see if this interaction could be furthering the issue. We are not sure
  exactly how this information will be used, but since it is relevant,
  we want to keep the option open to explore it. It is likely outside
  the scope of our research, but we are open to including it if we can
  find a way to.</p>
        <p> In this project, we will compare eight burned sites across
  Colorado that have experienced wildfires within the past 20 years.
  Sites will be selected to represent a range of geographic regions and
  burn severities, enabling analysis of how different conditions
  influence invasive species dynamics. In addition, two unburned sites
  serving as control locations will be selected from areas with no
  recorded wildfires during the same period. This site selection
  strategy aims to capture variability in post-fire plant communities
  and better understand the relationship between invasive species
  re-establishment risk and fire severity. </p>

            <bold>Data exploration</bold>
          </underline>
        </p>
        <p>The main dataset we will be using is current and future projection
  post-ire invasion risk by non-native short lived forbs and grasses
  Prevéy et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-prevey2024non-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>).
  This data is based on vegetation cover data from plots in the Western
  U.S that burned prior to sampling. Projected invasion risks post-fire
  were calculated using random forests with gridded climate, topographic
  predictor, and soil variables by Prevéy et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-prevey2024non-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>)
  .We will use the data projected under a high emission scenario. </p>
        <p>We will also use data from the USFS from 2005 that tracks invasive
  species prominence
  ( <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://research.fs.usda.gov/products/dataandtools/fia-datamart">https://research.fs.usda.gov/products/dataandtools/fia-datamart</ext-link>
  ). We will compare a total of 10 sites in Colorado that we will
  compare, trying to spread our sites out geographically and by severity
  of burn. We will pick sites that had been surveyed in 2005 and are
  also included in the projection data. </p>
        <p>Our projection data is in a spatial format, so we will need to
  extract data from longitude and latitude of the sites we select. We
  will also need data that shows fires in Colorado going back to at
  least 2005 that will include fire severity. </p>
        <p>In order to see where our spatial data and historic data overlap ,
  we had to take several steps. First I had to find a secondary dataset
  from the USFS that had latitude and longitude. Then, I preformed an
  innerjoin to get location information assigned to the sites:</p>

        <p>I was then able to get this visualization:</p>

        <graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="png" xlink:href="img/overlayingdata.png"/>
        <p>I am still trying to learn how to work with spatial data and need
  some additional help with getting to a testing phase, but will be in
  office hours tomorrow.</p>
        <p>
          <underline>
            <bold>Methods</bold>
          </underline>
        </p>
        <p>The first test we will run will be to model the influence of a
  functional group of invasive species to see how that affects the
  projection for fire and an invasive return interval. We will try out
  several models including a linear regression, random forest, and
  Xgboost. We will also use a Bayesian model to get uncertainty
  estimates and a more flexible hierarchical structure to represent
  random effects for the region or species. We will find the best model
  and then we can use that to make projection predictions for sites that
  we don’t have projection data for.  </p>
        <p>The second test we will run is an ANOVA test. With this test we
  will see if the mean invasion risk across our sights vary
  significantly. We could also potentially see if the risk of forbs or
  grasses are significantly different. We could also use this test to
  see if different burn severitys lead to different invasion risk. </p>
        <p>I believe that we have all the data we need for this project
  between our two datasets. One piece of supplemental data that might be
  useful  is data showing forest fires in Colorado. This would allow us
  to explore urn severity and its correlation to invasion risk. I think
  GIS or another form of spatial data would be ideal for this, but we
  are not sure if we will be able to do this on top of the other goals
  we have outlined.</p>
        <p>A potential challenge is that our historic data counts invasive
  species, while the projection data projects invasion risk. Therefore
  we are going to have to figure out a way to make the two different
  types of data comparable. I think that a visualization of invasive
  cover could be useful and might help to bridge that gap. </p>
        <p>Along with handling spatial data, we also grapple with how we carry
  out our approaches. In addition to ANOVA, linear regression, random
  forest, and XGBoost models will be used to assess associations between
  fire severity, vegetation cover, and invasion threat. These models
  will inform us of linear and non-linear relationships and allow us to
  assess predictive performance. Spatial autocorrelation is also an
  issue as it could affect results if areas close to one another are too
  alike each other. Finally, as invasion and fire are persistent
  processes, it could be difficult to see evident patterns with
  predominantly new data, and therefore model calibration and validation
  would be an important part of our methodology.</p>
        <p>The methods including ANOVA and learning models like random forest
  and XGBoost, will enable us to identify the most important predictors
  of invasive species spread and their effects on fire return intervals.
  Using a suite of methods, we will assess the extent to which different
  factors—like fire severity and region—drive invasion risk and enable
  us to predict future invasive species patterns across Colorado. We
  hope to apply these methods to improve our knowledge of how invasive
  species are altering fire return intervals and ecosystem health,
  guiding management and restoration.</p>

          <italic>Reburn and Return: How Invasive Species Influence Fire
  Return Intervals in Colorado.</italic>
        </title>

          <underline>
            <bold>Introduction, Background and
  Motivation</bold>
          </underline>
        </p>
        <p>Invasive plants and forest fires are significant issues in
  Colorado. Fire intensity and frequency, as well as the dominance of
  invasive species  are increasing in Colorado.   Invasions by
  non-native plant species after fire can negatively impact important
  ecosystem services and lead to invasion-fire cycles, which ultimately
  further degrade ecosystems Prevéy et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-prevey2024non-nb-1" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>)
  . Invasive species have negative impacts on ecosystems not limited to
  fire return intervals. Some of these impacts are disruption of species
  interactions, impact on successional recovery, introduction and spread
  of diseases, reduction in native species diversity, and economic
  losses Gallardo, Clavero, Sánchez, &amp; Vilà
  (<xref alt="2016" rid="ref-gallardo2016global-nb-1" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). </p>
        <p>Certain invasive species can alter fire frequencies and
  intensities, potentially increasing the occurrence of wildfires
  Gallardo et al.
  (<xref alt="2016" rid="ref-gallardo2016global-nb-1" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>)
  . The influence of non-native species on forest fire regimes is
  complex and varies by vegetative functional type and geographic region
  Prevéy et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-prevey2024non-nb-1" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>).
  This project will examine how different functional groups of invasive
  species impact fire return intervals, re-establishment rates, and
  expansion across Colorado. </p>
        <p>Furthermore, it has been established that native  species rely on
  soil microbiomes to establish on burned soil, while non-native do not;
  this makes non-natives more likely to establish quickly after forest
  fires and then dominate these disturbed sites Escobedo et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-escobedo2024native-nb-1" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>).
  However, scientific understanding of how to restore plant-soil
  microbiome interactions after wildfires remains limited, leading to a
  key knowledge gap in post- fire ecosystem restoration Escobedo et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-escobedo2024native-nb-1" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>).
  Escobedo’s research was done in a greenhouse in Chile, measuring
  establishment of native vs. non-native species in burned , unburned,
  and burned soil that was inoculated with native microbiome species
  Escobedo et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-escobedo2024native-nb-1" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>). 
  The study found that burned soil had higher levels of available
  nutrients, which benefited non-native species Escobedo et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-escobedo2024native-nb-1" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>).
  Furthermore, this study found that native species relied on the native
  microbiome while non-natives did not Escobedo et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-escobedo2024native-nb-1" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>).
  Taking this study into account, once we see what invasive species are
  an issue in Colorado relating to fire intervals, and then use
  information about plant-soil microbiome interactions from Escobedo to
  see if this interaction could be furthering the issue. We are not sure
  exactly how this information will be used, but since it is relevant,
  we want to keep the option open to explore it. It is likely outside
  the scope of our research, but we are open to including it if we can
  find a way to.</p>
        <p> In this project, we will compare eight burned sites across
  Colorado that have experienced wildfires within the past 20 years.
  Sites will be selected to represent a range of geographic regions and
  burn severities, enabling analysis of how different conditions
  influence invasive species dynamics. In addition, two unburned sites
  serving as control locations will be selected from areas with no
  recorded wildfires during the same period. This site selection
  strategy aims to capture variability in post-fire plant communities
  and better understand the relationship between invasive species
  re-establishment risk and fire severity. </p>

            <bold>Data exploration</bold>
          </underline>
        </p>
        <p>The main dataset we will be using is current and future projection
  post-ire invasion risk by non-native short lived forbs and grasses
  Prevéy et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-prevey2024non-nb-1" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>).
  This data is based on vegetation cover data from plots in the Western
  U.S that burned prior to sampling. Projected invasion risks post-fire
  were calculated using random forests with gridded climate, topographic
  predictor, and soil variables by Prevéy et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-prevey2024non-nb-1" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>)
  .We will use the data projected under a high emission scenario. </p>
        <p>We will also use data from the USFS from 2005 that tracks invasive
  species prominence
  ( <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://research.fs.usda.gov/products/dataandtools/fia-datamart">https://research.fs.usda.gov/products/dataandtools/fia-datamart</ext-link>
  ). We will compare a total of 10 sites in Colorado that we will
  compare, trying to spread our sites out geographically and by severity
  of burn. We will pick sites that had been surveyed in 2005 and are
  also included in the projection data. </p>
        <p>Our projection data is in a spatial format, so we will need to
  extract data from longitude and latitude of the sites we select. We
  will also need data that shows fires in Colorado going back to at
  least 2005 that will include fire severity. </p>
        <p>In order to see where our spatial data and historic data overlap ,
  we had to take several steps. First I had to find a secondary dataset
  from the USFS that had latitude and longitude. Then, I preformed an
  innerjoin to get location information assigned to the sites:</p>

        </sec>
        <p>I am still trying to learn how to work with spatial data and need
  some additional help with getting to a testing phase, but will be in
  office hours tomorrow.</p>
        <p>
          <underline>
            <bold>Methods</bold>
          </underline>
        </p>
        <p>The first test we will run will be to model the influence of a
  functional group of invasive species to see how that affects the
  projection for fire and an invasive return interval. We will try out
  several models including a linear regression, random forest, and
  Xgboost. We will also use a Bayesian model to get uncertainty
  estimates and a more flexible hierarchical structure to represent
  random effects for the region or species. We will find the best model
  and then we can use that to make projection predictions for sites that
  we don’t have projection data for.  </p>
        <p>The second test we will run is an ANOVA test. With this test we
  will see if the mean invasion risk across our sights vary
  significantly. We could also potentially see if the risk of forbs or
  grasses are significantly different. We could also use this test to
  see if different burn severitys lead to different invasion risk. </p>
        <p>I believe that we have all the data we need for this project
  between our two datasets. One piece of supplemental data that might be
  useful  is data showing forest fires in Colorado. This would allow us
  to explore urn severity and its correlation to invasion risk. I think
  GIS or another form of spatial data would be ideal for this, but we
  are not sure if we will be able to do this on top of the other goals
  we have outlined.</p>
        <p>A potential challenge is that our historic data counts invasive
  species, while the projection data projects invasion risk. Therefore
  we are going to have to figure out a way to make the two different
  types of data comparable. I think that a visualization of invasive
  cover could be useful and might help to bridge that gap. </p>
        <p>Along with handling spatial data, we also grapple with how we carry
  out our approaches. In addition to ANOVA, linear regression, random
  forest, and XGBoost models will be used to assess associations between
  fire severity, vegetation cover, and invasion threat. These models
  will inform us of linear and non-linear relationships and allow us to
  assess predictive performance. Spatial autocorrelation is also an
  issue as it could affect results if areas close to one another are too
  alike each other. Finally, as invasion and fire are persistent
  processes, it could be difficult to see evident patterns with
  predominantly new data, and therefore model calibration and validation
  would be an important part of our methodology.</p>
        <p>The methods including ANOVA and learning models like random forest
  and XGBoost, will enable us to identify the most important predictors
  of invasive species spread and their effects on fire return intervals.
  Using a suite of methods, we will assess the extent to which different
  factors—like fire severity and region—drive invasion risk and enable
  us to predict future invasive species patterns across Colorado. We
  hope to apply these methods to improve our knowledge of how invasive
  species are altering fire return intervals and ecosystem health,
  guiding management and restoration.</p>
